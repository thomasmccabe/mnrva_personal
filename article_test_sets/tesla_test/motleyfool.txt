A couple of key news items from the capital markets showed the highs and lows of the current market environment. After having faced pressure recently, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) decided to turn to investors to raise more cash by selling stock and bonds. At the other end of the spectrum, plant-based meat-substitute pioneer Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) said it would make its debut as a public company, pricing its initial public offering and providing another sign of the strong appetite for IPOs right now.

Shares of Tesla rose 2% after the electric-vehicle manufacturer filed disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a combination of securities to investors in order to raise cash. The move came just days after CEO Elon Musk had told shareholders that Tesla might turn to the public markets for more financing.

Specifically, Tesla said in a statement that it would offer $650 million in common stock to investors. In addition, the automaker will offer $1.35 billion in five-year convertible senior notes. In both cases, underwriters will have the right to purchase up to 15% more than initially offered, bringing the total potential capital raised up to the $2.3 billion mark.

Musk will also participate in the offering by buying $10 million in Tesla stock. That won't be enough to prevent his current position in the shares from being diluted, but it will cushion the blow somewhat.

Investors reacted favorably to the move, even though it still leaves some key questions unanswered. As the CEO said following Tesla's release of first-quarter financial results, "I don't think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate more effectively." How Tesla will improve its operational and financial discipline remains to be seen, but at least the electric-vehicle pioneer won't have to worry about having enough cash available for a while longer.
