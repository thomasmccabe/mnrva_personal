Lyft has removed thousands of electric bikes from city streets after users reported experiencing unexpectedly strong brakes.

In some cases, users were flipped over the front handlebars as a result of the issue.

Electric bikes have so far been pulled from New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.

The ride-hailing firm owns Motivate, which operates bike share systems across the U.S., including Citi Bike, Ford GoBike and Capital Bikeshare.

'We recently received a small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel,' Citi Bike said in a blog post.

'Out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively removing the pedal-assist bikes from service for the time being. 

'We know this is disappointing to the many people who love the current experience â€” but reliability and safety come first,' the firm said.

Citi Bike is now working to replace electric bikes with standard bikes so that service isn't interrupted in affected areas.
