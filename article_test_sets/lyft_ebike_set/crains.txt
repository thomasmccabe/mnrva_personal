An over-responsive brake has brought Citi Bike's planned expansion of pedal-assist bicycles in the city to a screeching halt.

The Lyft-owned company announced Sunday it is pulling its fleet of about 1,000 e-bikes from city streets. Citi Bike said in a statement that the company has received a "small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel."

A report in The New York Times Monday morning detailed three separate instances in which riders were thrown over the handlebars of pedal-assist bikes after making a sudden stop. Dozens of riders who have reported injuries while riding pedal-assist Citi Bikes in recent months, the Times reported.

Lyft is reportedly also pulling pedal-assisted bikes from bike-sharing programs it runs in Washington D.C. and San Francisco.

Streetsblog NYC, which first reported Citi Bike's decision, said the company began removing the bikes from city streets earlier in the weekend. Citi Bike announced in February that it planned to expand the number of pedal-assist bikes in the city to 4,000 by the start of summer. The company now says it will temporarily replace the pedal-assisted bikes with "classic" pedal bikes.

Officials with Citi Bike—which is competing in the e-bike market with the Uber-owned Jump Bike—said in the statement that the company is working on a new pedal-assist bike. But the company did not provide a timeline for when the new bikes would launch, other than "soon."
