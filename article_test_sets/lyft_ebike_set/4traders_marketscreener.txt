Citi Bike is pulling all of its pedal-assist electric bicycles from service after discovering a braking malfunction has catapulted several riders over the handlebars in recent weeks.

The bike-sharing network's owner Lyft announced the change Sunday, the latest hiccup in its plan to roll out 4,000 e-bikes across the five boroughs by June 21.

The announcement comes less than a month after an e-bike battery charging station sparked a fire at Citi Bike's maintenance hub in Brooklyn.

Lyft spokeswoman Julie Wood said the company is working to find the root cause of the braking issue, and the halt in e-bike service is only temporary.

The Daily News confirmed at least three people riding electric Citi Bikes received medical treatment over the past six weeks after hard-stopping front brakes caused them to fly over the handlebars.

E-bikes have also been pulled from Lyft's bike-sharing networks in Washington, D.C., and the Bay Area.

Workers at Citi Bike's facility aren't surprised by Lyft's decision to pull the easy-riding e-bikes -- one said the company has been aware of the problem for weeks.

"Everybody was waiting for a situation like this because they were worried someone was going to get hurt," said one Citi Bike employee. "The motor in the front of the bikes was locking up. (Citi Bike operator Motivate) brought people in who were putting oil on the brakes and it kept drying up."

Wood said Lyft has been working on a new e-bike model that will hit the streets soon, and that the e-bikes currently in service will be replaced by classic, pedal-powered two-wheelers.

"After a small number of reports and out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively pausing our electric bikes from service," said Wood. "Safety always comes first."
